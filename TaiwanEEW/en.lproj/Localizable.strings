"mechanics-title-string" = "About earthquake early warnings";
"mechanics-string" = "Earthquake early warnings are detected by the CWB, using shock waves detected by few seismic stations near the epicenter to  calculate the epicentral location, depth, scale and other earthquake information. If the earthquake's \"estimated magnitude reaches 4.5 and the maximum estimated intensity reaches 3\", an alarm will be issued immediately. (National PWS alerts are issued only for quakes with at least magnitude of 5.0 and the local intensity of 4.) Based on current technology, an earthquake that occurs on Taiwan Island can issue an alert within 20 seconds after the earthquake on average. The blind zone is about 70 kilometers, which represents the distance from the epicenter People within 70 kilometers will receive an alert only after they feel the shaking of the earthquake, and people outside the blind zone will have an early warning time of several seconds to tens of seconds.";
